# Vowel or Consonant Checker (C)

This C program determines whether a given alphabet is a vowel or a consonant.

## Description

The program prompts the user to enter an alphabet (a single character). It then converts the input to lowercase and checks if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u). If it is a vowel, the program prints that the character is a vowel. Otherwise, it prints that the character is a consonant.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the C code in a file named `vowelconsonant.c` (or any other name with a `.c` extension).

2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and use a C compiler (like GCC) to compile the code. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run the following command:

    ```bash
    gcc vowelconsonant.c -o vowelconsonant
    ```

    This will create an executable file named `vowelconsonant` (or `vowelconsonant.exe` on Windows).

3.  **Run:** Execute the compiled program by running the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    ./vowelconsonant  # On Linux/macOS
    vowelconsonant.exe # On Windows
    ```

4.  **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter an alphabet. Enter a single character (A-Z or a-z) and press Enter.

5.  **Output:** The program will print whether the entered character is a vowel or a consonant.
